-- The market rule says: the higher the return of a financial instrument, the higher the associated risk.

-- Task_4: Conversion of portfolio into rubles
-- Examine the *skyfinance.exchange_rate* table. Using it, you need to calculate the value of the entire portfolio in rubles.
-- Each bond must be converted into rubles at the exchange rate on the day the bond is issued.
-- If such a date is not in the *exchange_rate* table, then calculate the rate on that day as the average rate for the entire table.
-- Also add a field that will show how many rubles (based on the day of issue) the bond will bring in profit over its entire life.
-- To do this, you need to multiply the life expectancy by the interest rate by the nominal ruble value (based on the day of issue).
