# Data_Analytics-Portfolio
---

Hi, I'm Tamara Kirdiasheva an amateur Data Analyst. 

I came to data analytics from the field of circulation and registration of medical devices, where I also needed data analysis skills, but in a more primitive form. 
By studying clinical reports, which are often based on the analysis and interpretation of statistical data, I was able to see how, based on the data and their interpretation, appropriate conclusions can be made that can both positively and negatively affect the research process.
I believe it was this fact that brought me into the field of analytics.

This repository contains projects that I have completed that demonstrate my competence in data analytics. 
So far, this is mainly the work that I independently completed during my training. Workshop course "Data Analytics." 
However, I plan to actively replenish the portfolio with personal projects..

_Total number of projects in the repository:_ **15 **
